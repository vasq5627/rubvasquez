        <p> Modern technology is always advancing throughout everyday. Just yesterday, Tesla made a historical achievenment by using reusable rockets to send a tesla roadster to mars <br />
        We, as a society utalize technology each and everyday for personal matters to finincal purposes. We rely on different networks to complete our transactions and communications. <br />
        However, certain individuals have realized the reward behind illegally gaining data from users. These indiviudals are known as hackers, and the purpose behind their intentions <br />
        is for revenge, money, and/or chaos. And these hackers are categorized as; White Hats, Black Hats, and Grey Hats.</p>
        <ul >
                <li><span class="hackerType">White Hats: Has full permission from the company to hack the server to search for flaws in the security.</span></li>
                <li><span class="hackerType">Black Hats: Has no permission from the company and hacks the server for malevolent personal gain.</span></li>
                <li><span class="hackerType">No Hats/Grey Hats: Hacks the servers without any permission but notifies the company about their security flaws</span></li>
                <br /><br />
            </ul>
        <p>Thus, the intentions of this webpage is to talk about some techniques these hackers will utalized to gain access. Some techniques I will be going over are the various types <br />
        of malware, DDoS, and a method of attack as known as a man-in-the middle attack. </p>
