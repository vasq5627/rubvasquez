        <p> Modern technology is always advancing throughout every day. Just yesterday, Tesla made a historical achievement by using reusable rockets to send a Tesla Roadster to mars <br />
We, as a society utilize technology every day for personal matters to financial purposes. We rely on different networks to complete our transactions and communications. 
However, certain individuals have realized the reward behind illegally gaining data from users. These individuals are known as hackers, and the purpose behind their intentions is for <br />
revenge, money, and chaos. And these hackers are categorized as; White Hats, Black Hats, and Grey Hats.
</p>
        <ul >
                <li><span class="hackerType">White Hats: Has full permission from the company to hack the server to search for flaws in the security.</span></li>
                <li><span class="hackerType">Black Hats: Has no permission from the company and hacks the server for malevolent personal gain.</span></li>
                <li><span class="hackerType">No Hats/Grey Hats: Hacks the servers without any permission but notifies the company about their security flaws</span></li>
                <br /><br />
            </ul>
        <p>Thus, this webpage intends to talk about some techniques these hackers will be utilized to gain access. Some methods I will be going over are the various types 
of malware, DDoS, and a method of attack as known as a man-in-the-middle attack.
