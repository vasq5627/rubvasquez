        <h2> Man-In-Middle Attack: what is it? </h2>
        <p> Man in the middle attack involves a hacker intercepting packets that are being transmitted from one server <br />
        The hacker starts this process by using different software to "listen" on the packet transmission. From there <br />
        they choose what packets seem the most valuable to them and intercept those packets. As a result, the spoofed <br />
        packet is sent to the server where it will either be accepted or denied by the recieving server. Usally the  <br />
        will be able to identify if the packet has been tampered with, thus deny access. However, if the hacker is   <br />
        successful, then they will be able to send false information or utalize the phising technique to gain more  <br />
        information form the user. </p>
