        <h2>What is DDoS?</h2>
        <p> Distributed Denial of Service(DDos) is common attack among different networks. This attack is carried out by a hacker collecting an ample amount of zombie computers 
        otherwise known as botnets, to flood a specific server. The hacker gain control of botnets by simply infecting them with <b><a href="about1.html" target="_blank">malware </a></b>. Once these computers are 
        infected, they will await the hackers commands to attack. Thus, as the attack starts,the server will collect an overwhemling amount of traffic, then server will then shut down, thus creating a way in for the attacker.
        As a result, these attacks have the hacker gain a way in and input their own software to take control over the systems. The end result will be losing valuable data, losing control over the systems, and losing finanical investments.
